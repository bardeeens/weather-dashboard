# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.


## How it works

```
Users can see the weather outlook for multiple cities
so that they can plan their trips accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```

The user searches for a city
then is presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
When they view current weather conditions for that city
then they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
When they view the UV index
Then they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
When they view future weather conditions for that city
Users are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
When they click on a city in the search history
They are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
When they open the weather dashboard
They are presented with the last searched city forecast
